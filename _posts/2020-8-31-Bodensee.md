This shot was from the Bodensee in Lower Saxony, Germany. It captures the shoreline with clear clouds. A sailing ship can be seen just leaving the harbour. It's a melancholic shot, reflecting a great chasm betwenn comfort and ambition. It captures the saying "Ships are safe at the harbour but that is not what ships are meant for"
