			<h1>What happens to the dream</h1>
		</header>
		<p>
			What happens to the dream</br>
When the dreamer</br>
Cease to exist like rains in September</br>
What happens to the joys of fulfilment</br>
When the fulfilled fills a casket </br>
Shouldn't a dream live for ever</br>
Shouldn't our dreams walk right besides us in the beyond </br>
To remind of us why we lived in the first place</br>
Success and failure alike</br>
Good and evil alike</br>
To herald a transition like trumpets at the coronation of a king</br>
Then our dreams would speak for us when we see our ancestors</br> 
They will speak of our valor and cowardice </br>
Of our virtue and deficiency</br> 
And of our vice and vanity</br>
I wonder what dream will stand by me?
