					<h1>The Ghost of Rawi</h1>
				</header>
				<p>
					What happens to the dream <br>
					When the dreamer<br>
					Cease to exist like rains in September<br>
					What happens to the joys of fulfilment<br>
					When the fulfilled fills a casket <br>
					Shouldn't a dream live for ever<br>
					Shouldn't our dreams walk right besides us in the beyond <br>
					To remind of us why we lived in the first place<br>
					Success and failure alike<br>
					Good and evil alike<br>
					To herald a transition like trumpets at the coronation of a king<br>
					Then our dreams would speak for us when we see our ancestors<br> 
					They will speak of our valor and cowardice <br>
					Of our virtue and deficiency <br> 
					And of our vice and vanity <br>
					I wonder what dream will stand by me?

					<h1>Morning</h1>
				</header>
				<p>
					The cold winds piercing into your bones<br>
					The big mouthed hen calling out<br>
					The mouth tells a tale of a smelly past<br>
					The night dreams aftermath<br>
					The slow motion<br> 
					The sounds of plates and pots getting washed<br>
					The greetings that disturbs the silence<br>
					The clarity in the sky<br>
					A long hard dick that's how you know it's morning</p>

					<h1>War</h1>
				</header>
				<p>
					Life is a war a combination of small and great battles no one prepares you for <br>
					your parents are in the great battle of providing, 9-5 everyday if you are lucky you see them a quarter to four <br> 
					your teacher's are in the great battle of  occupation, pretend to you everything will be okay if  you know your abc and the numerals you can count beyond four<br>
					I wish someone had thought me the easiest path to get up when I fall<br>
					the foresight to sow seeds in winter and harvest during fall<br>
					to persevere and climb through when i meet a wall<br>
					rather than encourage me to wear the armour of fallen soldiers<br>
					under prepare me with the bland knowledge that didn't save my fore fathers <br>
					discourage me to love my brothers and fellow soldiers<br>
					the first battle is to control you urination when you sleep at night<br>
					damnation awaits the child that does not get this right<br>
					not to speak of when your friends know your plight<br>
					then they tag you "he who wets the bed every night"<br>
					the child cries and cries<br>
					the mama says dont worry little child<br>
					for everything will be alright<br>
					soon the prophecy comes to pass<br>
					but like everything in life<br>
					the war is yet to come to pass

					<h1>Big bunda</h1>
				</header>
				<p>
					She likes me you like her but she is in love with money <br>
					She tells me am the only man in her life but still calls you my honey <br>
					When she leaves my place she comes to your place and still call you my one and only <br>
					spent the night on your bed but when i call her in the morning she says i <br>
					Miss you my darling <br>
					She is my fiancee your future wife and and a john doe's girlfriend <br>
					We trust her lies hate her truth believe her curves ands bends <br>
					her truths are few her tricks are huge but her backside is terrible</p>
