				<p>
					What happens to the dream <br>
					When the dreamer<br>
					Cease to exist like rains in September<br>
					What happens to the joys of fulfilment<br>
					When the fulfilled fills a casket <br>
					Shouldn't a dream live for ever<br>
					Shouldn't our dreams walk right besides us in the beyond <br>
					To remind of us why we lived in the first place<br>
					Success and failure alike<br>
					Good and evil alike<br>
					To herald a transition like trumpets at the coronation of a king<br>
					Then our dreams would speak for us when we see our ancestors<br> 
					They will speak of our valor and cowardice <br>
					Of our virtue and deficiency <br> 
					And of our vice and vanity <br>
					I wonder what dream will stand by me?

					<h1>War</h1>
				</header>
				<p>
					Life is a war a combination of small and great battles no one prepares you for <br>
					your parents are in the great battle of providing, 9-5 everyday if you are lucky you see them a quarter to four <br> 
					your teacher's are in the great battle of  occupation, pretend to you everything will be okay if  you know your abc and the numerals you can count beyond four<br>
					I wish someone had thought me the easiest path to get up when I fall<br>
					the foresight to sow seeds in winter and harvest during fall<br>
					to persevere and climb through when i meet a wall<br>
					rather than encourage me to wear the armour of fallen soldiers<br>
					under prepare me with the bland knowledge that didn't save my fore fathers <br>
					discourage me to love my brothers and fellow soldiers<br>
					the first battle is to control you urination when you sleep at night<br>
					damnation awaits the child that does not get this right<br>
					not to speak of when your friends know your plight<br>
					then they tag you "he who wets the bed every night"<br>
					the child cries and cries<br>
					the mama says dont worry little child<br>
					for everything will be alright<br>
					soon the prophecy comes to pass<br>
					but like everything in life<br>
					the war is yet to come to pass

					<h1>Ode to a friend</h1>
				</header>
				<p>
					Life takes us through several routes <br>
					Adding and substracting endlessly to our circle of friends <br>
					If we get lucky we get a great addition <br>
					The circle becomes bigger<br>
					Sometimes the circle shrinks<br>
					We get a painful substraction<br>
					Soon we heal, revitalized for another addition<br>
					Painfully our next encounter might be another substraction<br>
					But nonethess we forge on; time heals our wound<br>
					Our prejudice often unbalance the equation making us add when should substract and vice versa<br>
					I met a great friend in a great place at a great time in my life<br> 
					Life brought her my way<br>
					My prejudice made me add her to the circle<br>
					At some point it seemed like a bad decision<br>
					But providence has never failed me<br>
					I only get more reassured everyday that it was a good decision<br>
 					alot even suggests she might get subtracted soon<br>
					but that only makes me smile though it hurts to some degree even the thought of it<br>
					I find lasting peace and calmess in the moments we shared.<br>
					You were a great addition my friend!

					<h1>Politicians Vs Armed robbers</h1>
				</header>
				<p>
					What comes into the mind of the unrepentant robber<br>
					Once he enters the house<br>
					I will make myself rich with their money<br>
					What comes into the mind of the<br>
					corrupt politician<br>
					Once he enters the office<br>
					I will make myself rich with their money<br>
					Don't you see it<br>
					It's all the same thing<br>
					I know that while one does it at night when you least expect and when you're most afraid<br>
					The other does it during the day when you're most conscious and least afraid<br>
					But which one goes to jail and which one goes to London<br>
					Only my people can tell you!<br>
