					<h1>The Ghost of Rawi</h1>

					What happens to the dream <br>
					When the dreamer<br>
					Cease to exist like rains in September<br>
					What happens to the joys of fulfilment<br>
					When the fulfilled fills a casket <br>
					Shouldn't a dream live for ever<br>
					Shouldn't our dreams walk right besides us in the beyond <br>
					To remind of us why we lived in the first place<br>
					Success and failure alike<br>
					Good and evil alike<br>
					To herald a transition like trumpets at the coronation of a king<br>
					Then our dreams would speak for us when we see our ancestors<br> 
					They will speak of our valor and cowardice <br>
					Of our virtue and deficiency <br> 
					And of our vice and vanity <br>
					I wonder what dream will stand by me?

					<h1>Morning</h1>
				</header>
				<p>
					The cold winds piercing into your bones<br>
					The big mouthed hen calling out<br>
					The mouth tells a tale of a smelly past<br>
					The night dreams aftermath<br>
					The slow motion<br> 
					The sounds of plates and pots getting washed<br>
					The greetings that disturbs the silence<br>
					The clarity in the sky<br>
					A long hard dick that's how you know it's morning</p>
